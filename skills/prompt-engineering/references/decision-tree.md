# Prompt Technique Selection Decision Tree

Use this decision tree to systematically select the appropriate prompting technique for an agentic system.

## Decision Tree

### Step 1: Does the agent use tools autonomously?
- **Yes → ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting loop couples thought and action)
- **No → Step 2**

### Step 2: Is the task multi-step or reasoning-heavy?
- **Yes → Step 3**
- **No → Step 5**

### Step 3: Are there multiple viable solution paths?
- **Yes → Tree of Thoughts** (Explores alternatives for planning/strategy)
- **No → Step 4**

### Step 4: Is correctness more important than speed?
- **Yes → Self-Consistency** (Multiple reasoning paths for verification)
- **No → Chain of Thought** (Single-path reasoning)

**Alternative for factual accuracy**: Use **Chain-of-Verification (CoVe)** when reducing hallucinations is more important than reasoning consistency

### Step 5: Is a consistent behavior, format, or tone required?
- **Yes → Few-Shot** (Examples establish patterns)
- **No → Step 6**

### Step 6: Is the task simple and well-defined?
- **Yes → Zero-Shot** (Minimal overhead for clear tasks)
- **No → Step 7**

### Step 7: Can the problem be decomposed into sequential subproblems?
- **Yes → Least-to-Most Prompting** (Break down and solve sequentially)
- **No → Step 8**

### Step 8: Would self-critique improve the output quality?
- **Yes → Self-Refine** (Model reviews and improves its own output)
- **No → Step 9**

### Step 9: Is a specific domain expertise required?
- **Yes → Role Prompting** (Narrows reasoning space with expertise)
- **No → Instruction Tuning** (Structured, numbered instructions)
